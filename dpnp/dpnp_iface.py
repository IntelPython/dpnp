def remainder(x1, x2):
    """
    Return element-wise remainder of division.

    Computes the remainder complementary to the `floor_divide` function.  It is
    equivalent to the Python modulus operator``x1 % x2`` and has the same sign
    as the divisor `x2`. The MATLAB function equivalent to ``np.remainder``
    is ``mod``.

    .. warning::

    This should not be confused with:

    * Python 3.7's `math.remainder` and C's ``remainder``, which
      computes the IEEE remainder, which are the complement to
      ``round(x1 / x2)``.
    * The MATLAB ``rem`` function and or the C ``%`` operator which is the
      complement to ``int(x1 / x2)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1 : array_like
        Dividend array.
    x2 : array_like
        Divisor array. If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable
        to a common shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
    out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the
        :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The element-wise remainder of the quotient ``floor_divide(x1, x2)``.
        This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    See Also
    --------
    floor_divide : Equivalent of Python ``//`` operator.
    divmod : Simultaneous floor division and remainder.
    fmod : Equivalent of the MATLAB ``rem`` function.
    divide, floor

    Notes
    -----
    Returns 0 when `x2` is 0 and both `x1` and `x2` are (arrays of)
    integers.
    ``mod`` is an alias of ``remainder``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.remainder([4, 7], [2, 3])
    array([0, 1])
    >>> np.remainder(np.arange(7), 5)
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1])

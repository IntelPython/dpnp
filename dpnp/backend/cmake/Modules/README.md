# oneAPI CMake scripts vendored from Intel oneAPI BaseKit 2023.0.0

This is done to work around absence of this script in onedpl-devel conda
package. Once it is added, expected 2023.2.0, this vendored package is
to be removed.

tbb-devel script has been modified to allow it to work correctly in conda
environment.

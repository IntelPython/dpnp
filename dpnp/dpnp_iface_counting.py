Interface of the counting function of the dpnp

Notes
-----
This module is a face or public interface file for the library
it contains:
 - Interface functions
 - documentation for the functions
 - The functions parameters check

    Counts the number of non-zero values in the array ``in_array1``.

    For full documentation refer to :obj:`numpy.count_nonzero`.

    Limitations
    -----------
        Parameter ``x1`` is supported as :obj:`dpnp.ndarray`.
        Otherwise the function will be executed sequentially on CPU.
        Parameter ``axis`` is supported only with default value `None`.
        Parameter ``keepdims`` is supported only with default value `False`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import dpnp as np
    >>> np.count_nonzero(np.array([1, 0, 3, 0, 5])
    3
    >>> np.count_nonzero(np.array([[1, 0, 3, 0, 5],[0, 9, 0, 7, 0]]))

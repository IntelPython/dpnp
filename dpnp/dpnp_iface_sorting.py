    Returns the indices that would sort an array.

    For full documentation refer to :obj:`numpy.argsort`.

    Limitations
    -----------
    Input array is supported as :obj:`dpnp.ndarray`.
    Otherwise the function will be executed sequentially on CPU.
    Prameters ``axis`` is supported only with default value ``-1``.
    Prameters ``kind`` is supported only with default value ``None``.
    Prameters ``order`` is supported only with default value ``None``.
    Input array data types are limited by supported DPNP :ref:`Data types`.

    See Also
    --------
    :obj:`dpnp.sort` : Describes sorting algorithms used.
    :obj:`dpnp.lexsort` : Indirect stable sort with multiple keys.
    :obj:`dpnp.argpartition` : Indirect partial sort.
    :obj:`dpnp.take_along_axis` : Apply ``index_array`` from argsort to
                                  an array as if by calling sort.

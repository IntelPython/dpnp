Interface of the Indexing part of the DPNP

Notes
-----
This module is a face or public interface file for the library
it contains:
 - Interface functions
 - documentation for the functions
 - The functions parameters check

    Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.

    For full documentation refer to :obj:`numpy.nonzero`.

    Limitations
    -----------
    Input array is supported as :obj:`dpnp.ndarray`.
    Otherwise the function will be executed sequentially on CPU.
    Input array data types are limited by supported DPNP :ref:`Data types`.

    See Also
    --------
    :obj:`dpnp.flatnonzero` : Return indices that are non-zero in
                              the flattened version of the input array.
    :obj:`dpnp.count_nonzero` : Counts the number of non-zero elements
                                in the input array.

    Notes
    -----
    While the nonzero values can be obtained with ``a[nonzero(a)]``, it is
    recommended to use ``x[x.astype(bool)]`` or ``x[x != 0]`` instead, which
    will correctly handle 0-d arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import dpnp as np
    >>> x = np.array([[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [5, 6, 0]])
    >>> out = np.nonzero(x)
    >>> for arr in out:
    >>>     [i for i in arr]
    [0, 1, 2, 2]
    [0, 1, 0, 1]

    >>> x2 = np.array([3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 6, 0])
    >>> out2 = np.nonzero(x2)
    >>> for arr in out2:
    >>>     [i for i in arr]
    [0, 4, 6, 7]

def nonzero(a):
    """
    Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.

    Returns a tuple of arrays, one for each dimension of `a`,
    containing the indices of the non-zero elements in that
    dimension. The values in `a` are always tested and returned in
    row-major, C-style order.

    To group the indices by element, rather than dimension, use `argwhere`,
    which returns a row for each non-zero element.

    .. note::

       When called on a zero-d array or scalar, ``nonzero(a)`` is treated
       as ``nonzero(atleast1d(a))``.

       .. deprecated:: 1.17.0

          Use `atleast1d` explicitly if this behavior is deliberate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple_of_arrays : tuple
        Indices of elements that are non-zero.

    See Also
    --------
    flatnonzero :
        Return indices that are non-zero in the flattened version of the input
        array.
    ndarray.nonzero :
        Equivalent ndarray method.
    count_nonzero :
        Counts the number of non-zero elements in the input array.

    Notes
    -----
    While the nonzero values can be obtained with ``a[nonzero(a)]``, it is
    recommended to use ``x[x.astype(bool)]`` or ``x[x != 0]`` instead, which
    will correctly handle 0-d arrays.

    Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,

    - If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors
      (without complex conjugation).

    - If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication,
      but using :func:`matmul` or ``a @ b`` is preferred.

    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to :func:`multiply`
      and using ``numpy.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is preferred.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is an M-D array (where ``M>=2``), it is a
      sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of `b`::

        dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        First argument.
    b : array_like
        Second argument.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
        if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
        C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
        for `dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
        conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
        to be flexible.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
        scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
        an array is returned.
        If `out` is given, then it is returned.

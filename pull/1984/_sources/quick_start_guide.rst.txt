Quick Start Guide

Device Drivers
=================

To start programming data parallel devices beyond CPU, you will need
an appropriate hardware. The Data Parallel Extension for NumPy* works fine
on Intel |copy| laptops with integrated graphics. In majority of cases,
your Windows*-based laptop already has all necessary device drivers installed.
But if you want the most up-to-date driver, you can always
`update it to the latest one <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html>`_.
Follow device driver installation instructions to complete the step.


Python Interpreter
==================

You will need Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 installed on your system. If you
do not have one yet the easiest way to do that is to install
`Intel Distribution for Python*`_. It installs all essential Python numerical
and machine learning packages optimized for the Intel hardware, including
Data Parallel Extension for NumPy*.
If you have Python installation from another vendor, it is fine too. All you
need is to install Data Parallel Extension for NumPy* manually as shown
in the next installation section.


Installation
============

Install Package from Intel(R) channel
-------------------------------------------

You will need one of the commands below:

* Conda: ``conda install dpnp -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/ -c conda-forge``

* Pip: ``python -m pip install --index-url https://pypi.anaconda.org/intel/simple dpnp``

These commands install dpnp package along with its dependencies, including
``dpctl`` package with `Data Parallel Control Library`_ and all required
compiler runtimes and OneMKL.

.. note::
   Before installing with conda or pip it is strongly advised to update ``conda`` and ``pip`` to latest versions


Build and Install Conda Package
-------------------------------

Alternatively you can create and activate a local conda build environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n build-env conda-build
    conda activate build-env

And to build dpnp package from the sources:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda build conda-recipe -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/ -c conda-forge

Finally, to install the result package:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install dpnp -c local


Build and Install with scikit-build
-----------------------------------

Another way to build and install dpnp package from the source is to use Python
``setuptools`` and ``scikit-build``. You will need to create a local conda
build environment by command below depending on hosting OS.

On Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n build-env dpctl cython dpcpp_linux-64 mkl-devel-dpcpp tbb-devel onedpl-devel cmake scikit-build ninja pytest -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/ -c conda-forge
    conda activate build-env

On Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n build-env dpctl cython dpcpp_win-64 mkl-devel-dpcpp tbb-devel onedpl-devel cmake scikit-build ninja pytest -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/ -c conda-forge
    conda activate build-env

To build and install the package on Linux OS, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install -- -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:PATH=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:PATH=icpx

To build and install the package on Windows OS, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install -- -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:PATH=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:PATH=icx

Alternatively, to develop on Linux OS, you can use the driver script:

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/build_locally.py


Testing
=======

If you want to execute the scope of Python test suites which are available
by the source, you will need to run a command as below:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -s tests

Examples
========

The examples below demonstrates a simple usage of the Data Parallel Extension for NumPy*

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example_sum.py
  :linenos:
  :language: python
  :lines: 35-
  :caption: How to create an array and to sum the elements

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example_cfd.py
  :linenos:
  :language: python
  :lines: 34-
  :caption: How to create an array on the specific device type and how the next computations follow it

More examples on how to use ``dpnp`` can be found in ``dpnp/examples``.
